## Transforming Ideas into Engaging Experiences with NextJS and GSAP

Excited to share my latest landing page project, built using NextJs with GSAP animations to enhance user engagement and provide a memorable experience from the moment the page loads.

In this project, I focused on:

Smooth Animations: Using GSAP to create a timeline of animations, making the content come to life without impacting performance.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the layout remains visually appealing and accessible across all devices.
Optimized Video Background: Leveraging video overlays with optimized load settings for an immersive feel without slowing down the page.
Building this landing page was a great opportunity to refine my skills in creating interactive UIs that blend creativity with performance.
